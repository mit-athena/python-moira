==================
Installing PyMoira
==================

To install PyMoira, you will first need to install Cython. It's always
a good idea to install Pyrex through your package manager, if
possible. Your system's Pyrex package may be named ``python3-Cython`` or
``cython3``. If your package manager doesn't have a package for
Pyrex, or if you wish to install Pyrex by hand anyway, you can do so
by running::

  $ pip install Cython

Once you've done that, to install PyMoira globally, run::

  $ pip install .

If you want to build PyMoira without installing it globally, you may
want to run::

  $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

which will build the C extensions in place next to their source,
allowing you to import the various modules, so long as your current
working directory is the root of the PyMoira source tree.

Alternatively, PyMoira has been packaged for Debian and Ubuntu. To
build the Debian package of the latest release, run::

_(NOTE: deb generation is untested)_

  $ git checkout debian
  $ git buildpackage
  $ sudo debi

You will need the devscripts and git-buildpackage packages installed,
as well as this package's build dependencies (debhelper, cdbs,
python-all-dev, python-support, python-pyrex, python-setuptools,
debathena-libmoira-dev).
